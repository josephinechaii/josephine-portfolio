Learn about Bootstrap - it's easy.

There are three things you must use

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class"col-.......">

This makes the website responsive

The col-md-4, col-sm-12, col-xs-12 is telling it what to do with the element when it's being shown on a desktop, laptop, or mobile phone

Look at my portfolio and go to the photography projects - go to Lavender Fields
It's three images on each row, right? That is because I used col-md-4

The greatest is 12 so if I was three on each row it has to be col-md-4
But when it's viewed on a mobile phone, it is one per row that is because I used col-xs-12 - that means the element (image) takes up the whole row
